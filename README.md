##Line tracking underwater.py Algorithm

camera is used to follow the
tracks autonomously. used a python library
named "Open CV" to detect lines using the "mask" function,
which filters out all but blue lines. Using mathematical
calculations, we were able to get the distance between the
two blue lines and the average slope.

##detect Yolo v3.py Algorithm

i'm using a python library named "ImageAI" and it use "Keras" and "Tensorflow" and use Darknet layers

YOLOv3 Keras R-CNN
